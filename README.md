# Project Name

Project Description: This project aims to build a knowledge graph and implement a series of functionalities related to dialectical treatment. Below is a brief description of each file in the project:

## Data Storage

The data for the knowledge graph is stored in the `Data\CreateDate` directory. The data is stored in xlsx format due to the ease of operation provided by Excel.

## createKG.py

The `createKG.py` file implements the functionality to build the knowledge graph. It reads the data stored in the `Data\CreateDate` directory and constructs the knowledge graph based on predefined rules.

## Differential_diagnosis.py

The `Differential_diagnosis.py` file contains functions that implement the interpretable dialectical functionality. It performs dialectical analysis based on the input medical condition information and provides explanations for the dialectical results.

## verify_dialectical.py

The `verify_dialectical.py` file contains functions that verify the dialectical functionality. It reads the validation data stored in the `Data` directory and performs verification on the dialectical functionality.

## Treatment_function1.py

The `Treatment_function1.py` file implements the traditional dialectical treatment functionality. It performs dialectical analysis based on the medical condition information and recommends the most probable prescription name as treatment advice.

## Treatment_function2.py

The code in `Treatment_function2.py` file implements disease identification and treatment functionality. It identifies the disease based on the medical condition information and performs treatment based on the identified disease.

The above is a summary of the functionalities of each file in the project. For detailed usage instructions and considerations, please refer to the comments and documentation within each file.
